<h1>The Best Movies According to Tiffany</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>La La Land</h3>
<p>Saw this when I was 14 and it got me into movies so it holds a special place in my heart.</p>
<h3>Anatomy of a Fall</h3>
<p>Courtroom drama that questions the nature of truth and the different sides to people and their relationships. By turns thrilling and moving.</p>
<h3>Nomadland</h3>
<p>Just beautiful, I always cry loads.</p>
